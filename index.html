<article>
        <p> Python has come alive and is killing people on the internet. Experts say the computer programming language known as Python 3 is so high level that it is somehow has taken on a life of it's own. Experts belive the launguage was added to a resent artificial inteligence (AI) project and instead of the robot becomming intellegent the computer language called python did! </p>
            <h3>Python adapted quickly.</h3>
        <p>The python launguage adapted to it new found inteligence quickly and started attacking within hours after it's creation. Why? We can only speculate.</p>

        <h2>Panic sets in after reports of many deaths.</h2>
<p> Only hours after it's creation people across the globe turned on their computers to find a large angry python on thier screens. While it is unknown exactly how the python kills though the internet, largely due to dying, there is speculation based on a few screenshots taken upon death that it actually uses your computer to attack you. Everyone reading this will most likely die soon if you are not dead already! Due to fear many people are destroying all of their computer equipment and cell phones.</p>
